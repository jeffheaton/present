For this course, we will execute the code using the free version of [Google CoLab](https://colab.research.google.com/), which provides a free [GPU](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus). You do not need to install any software on your local computer. The code presented during the course has no dependencies on CoLab, and you could execute the code on your local machine; however, installing deep learning with full GPU support can be a tricky installation process. Also, not all computers have a GPU compatible with deep learning.

You will store your files on [Google Drive](https://www.google.com/drive/). Please make sure that you can access both CoLab and Google Drive. The following video presents a quick overview of Python on CoLab in the way we will use both in this course.
