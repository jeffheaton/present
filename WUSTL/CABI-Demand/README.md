For this course we will execute the code using the free version of [Google CoLab](https://colab.research.google.com/), which provides a free [GPU](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus). GPUs are critical to deep learning programming because the speed the calculations and training time. You will store your files on [Google Drive](https://www.google.com/drive/). Please make sure that you can access both CoLab and Google Drive. The following video presents a quick overview of Python on CoLab in the way that we will use both in this course.
