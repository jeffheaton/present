I've found that Colab Pro generally starts you with a V100, however, if you run scripts non-stop for 24hrs straight for a few days in a row, you will generally be throttled back to a P100.\n",

Training is divided into ticks, every so many ticks (50 by default) your neural network is evaluated and a snapshot is saved.  When CoLab shuts down, all training after the last snapshot is lost. It might seem desirable to snapshot after each tick; however, this snapshotting process itself takes nearly an hour.  It is important to learn an optimal snapshot size for your resolution and training data.\n",
