    "# Training StyleGAN2 in Google CoLab\n",
    "\n",
    "GANs can be trained with either Google Colab Free or Pro.  The Pro version is reccomended due to better GPU instances, longer runtimes, and timeouts.  Make sure that you are running this notebook with a GPU runtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your training data and trained neural networks will be stored to GDRIVE.  For GANs, I lay out my GDRIVE like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "* ./data/gan/images - RAW images I wish to train on.\n",
    "* ./data/gan/datasets - Actual training datasets that I convert from the raw images.\n",
    "* ./data/gan/experiments - The output from StyleGAN2, my image previews and saved network snapshots.\n",

    "# What Sort of GPU do you Have?\n",
    "\n",
    "The type of GPU assigned to you by Colab will greatly affect your training time. Some sample times that I achieved with Colab are given here.  I've found that Colab Pro generally starts you with a V100, however, if you run scripts non-stop for 24hrs straight for a few days in a row, you will generally be throttled back to a P100.\n",
    "\n",
    "* 1024x1024 - V100 - 566 sec/tick (CoLab Pro)\n",
    "* 1024x1024 - P100 - 1819 sec/tick (CoLab Pro)\n",
    "* 1024x1024 - T4 - 2188 sec/tick (CoLab Free)\n",
    "\n",
    "If you use Google CoLab Pro, generally, it will not disconnect before 24 hours, even if you (but not your script) are inactive.  Free CoLab WILL disconnect a perfectly good running script if you do not interact for a few hours.  The following describes how to circumvent this issue.\n",

    "You will likely need to train for >24 hours.  Colab will disconnect you.  You must be prepared to restart training when this eventually happens.  Training is divided into ticks, every so many ticks (50 by default) your neural network is evaluated and a snapshot is saved.  When CoLab shuts down, all training after the last snapshot is lost. It might seem desirable to snapshot after each tick; however, this snapshotting process itself takes nearly an hour.  It is important to learn an optimal snapshot size for your resolution and training data.\n",
